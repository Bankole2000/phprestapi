## What it is

An simple, well-commented, learning oriented, single page JS demo Project to practice ES6 programming concepts, using `fetch API, Primses, async await` (all that good stuff) and the `EventBrite API`. Built with:

- HTML
- Vanilla JS - ES6
- [Bootswatch CSS](http://www.bootswatch.com/) - A Bootstrap based CSS Theming tool
- [EventBrite API](https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/) - A really well built API.
- [Awesomeness](https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Programming) - Strictly for the love of coding _Mehn!_

## What it does

- Fetches Categories of Events from EventBrite
- Finds Events based on User Entry and Category
- Displays Event Data with image, title and brief description
- Shows which Events are free and which are paid for
- Provides Link to Get tickets for events

## Learning Points

- ES6 Classes
- Fetch API
- Promises
- Async Await
- Iternary and Template Strings
- DOM Manipulation & Traversal
- Event Handing & Delegation
- Creating & Appending Elements
- A lil Bootstrap 4 syntax n Alerts

## Some cool stuff

I'll gist about this later... but it's coming alright...

```javascript
// Javascript code will be here... It's just classes mostly
```

> Also (Just a sidenote), I I personally find it a lot easier to use than most other event finding apps.

## Features in Development

I'm thinking to add functionality to get more detailed info on events
like Venue n such
