## What it is

An very basic, well-commented, learning oriented, basic Restful API for a simple Blog Built with:

- PHP 🐘
- MySQL

## :electric_plug: What it does
Features 2 basic resources - **Posts** and **Categories** and API endpoints to handle basic Client Requests;
- _Post_ (Create) new Posts and Categories
- _Get_ all Posts/Categories
- _Get_ single Post/Category by `id` in query string
- _Update_ and _Delete_ single Post/Category by `id` in body

## 💡Learning Points

- PHP Classes
- PDO
- Postman
- API Documentation

## Some cool stuff

I'll gist about this later... but it's coming alright...

```php
/* Some Php code will be here... It's just classes 
 mostly */
```

> Also (Just a sidenote), I personally find this a lot easier to understand and build than `NodeJS` & `Express` APIs.

## Features in Development
More areas to explore in this regard are
* User Authentication
* Protected Routes
* Handling Multiform data
